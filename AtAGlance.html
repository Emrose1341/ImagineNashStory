    <h1>Hypertension At A Glance</h1>
	<h2> The high prevalence of hypertension in the United States has profound implications for community health, leading to increased healthcare costs, heightened utilization of medical services, and reduced life expectancy. According to the American Heart Association, hypertension contributes to approximately $131 billion in healthcare costs annually, primarily due to complications such as heart disease and stroke, which necessitate extensive medical interventions  (1) . This financial burden is exacerbated by the fact that individuals with uncontrolled hypertension often require frequent hospitalizations and emergency care, straining local healthcare systems  (2) . Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that hypertension is a leading cause of premature death in the U.S., significantly impacting life expectancy, particularly among marginalized communities who may face barriers to accessing preventive care  (3) . Addressing hypertension through community-based interventions and education is essential to mitigate its economic and health-related impacts, ultimately improving the quality of life and longevity for affected populations  (4) . Tennessee communities are disproportionately impacted by hypertension and its burden of disease, ranking 6th nationally  (5)  in the percentage of adults with hypertension, and 3rd in deaths caused by hypertensive disease.  As we will discuss throughout this report, Nashville compares favorably to state levels of hypertension, but segments of our population are more heavily impacted, causing extreme disparities across communities.<h2>
